### Predicting of magma chemistry/lithology/alteration styles from assays
Question: is it possible to tell the type of rock from assays without the involvement of a human, and distinguish mineralized rocks from barren ones? 
Currently can predict some labels, but there is confusion for some rock types

### Identifying fluid inclusions with CNN and counting phase proportions
Question: in this quartz image, what is an inclusion, what is a defect, what is noise?
How much salt/water/gas in the inclusions?
